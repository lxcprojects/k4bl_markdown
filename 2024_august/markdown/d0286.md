# Summary   
An enslaved man named Pierrot was sold to enslaver Michèl Brosset by Claude Boisson ("*tailladier en cette ville*," tool maker in this city) and his wife, Magdelaine Chenier, who had acquired Pierrot as a *piece d'inde* from the Company of the Indies[^i]. However, Pierrot went missing after having gone maroon. Boisson and Chenier promise to catch Pierrot for Brosset in exchange for cash upon delivery, which they succeed in accomplishing.

Present were Claude Boisson, tool maker in this city, and Magdelaine Chenier, his wife, who authorized for these proceedings which, per those present, have sold and promise to deliver to Sieur Michèl Brosset, resident in this city, a *nègre pièce d’inde* named Pierrot, guaranteed from all troubles and impediments[to whom] against all odds [he] will belong. And as the aforesaid nègre has runaway, the said sellers oblige themselves to take him back into their hands from the said Sieur Purchaser, as soon as they will [have a chance to] catch him. The said purchaser, knowing perfectly well the said *nègre* and being happy as the result of being able to enjoy him, and the gentlemen [who have] known [of him] as property belonging to him as well as the said Boisson, who acquired [him] from the Company of the Indies, to whom [he] was paid, according to the attached license from Sieur Dumanoir, agent of the Company, dated the twenty first of present [year]. The said sale and transfer thus [is] made by means of the price and sum of fifteen hundred livres that the said Brosset promises

to pay him in cash upon delivery of the said nègre by means of which these proceedings will constitute receipt. And another formality,as expected, given there is no special claim on the said *nègre*, the said *Sieur* Brosset will retain free and clear possession without which, for any reason, [possession] can be disturbed, as is generally typical [for] whomever is the promisee [party]. The said sellers guarantee and indemnify against any and all       by virtue of title, as it has been agreed between the parties, thus, the promisee obliges and forswears. [It was] done and passed at New Orleans in ministerial office in the year one thousand seven hundred thirty nine, the twenty second of July, in presence of the gentlemen François Roumier and François Jahan, witnesses residing there [in the city], and [before] the said Boisson and his wife, declaring not knowing how to write nor sign of [which has been] inquired, in accordance with the law.

## Notes  
[^i]: "In 1728, Jean-Baptiste Labat described the *pièce d’Inde*, the primary measure of commercial exchange on the West African coast as a “measure of potential labor.” The *pièce d’Inde* derived from the *pieza de India*, which entered circulation during the first centuries of slave trading under the Spanish and Portuguese," writes Johnson, *Wicked Flesh: Black Women, Intimacy and Freedom in the Atlantic World* (Penn Press, 2020), 80. "By the eighteenth century, for French traders, a *pièce d’Inde*, according to Labat, was a male slave, between eight and thirty years old, with all of his digits and limbs, as well as 'eyes, ears, teeth,' and was not 'hunchbacked or lame.'"
