## Notes

[^i]: When Mathurin Simar married Anne Vignode in New Orleans in 1725, the priest identified Simar as a sailor for the Company of the Indies. See July 24, 1725 in Saint Louis Cathedral Marriages, 1720-1730, Archives of the Archdiocese of New Orleans. By the time Cesar dumped Mathurin Simar(d)’s things into the river in 1739, Simar described himself as the “Patron des Bateaux du Roy.” When he returned to New Orleans after the war, Simard petitioned the estate of the recently deceased enslaver of Cesar, a man named Jacques de Coustillas. Simard demanded four hundred *livres* for the clothing that Cesar dumped into the river. To see that record, view manuscript page 11339 on March 2, 1739: [https://lacolonialdocs.org/document/4041](https://lacolonialdocs.org/document/4041). 

[^ii]: France waged a second campaign against the Chickasaw Nation in 1739 after losing disastrously in battle in 1736. They built two forts, Fort St. Francis and Fort Assumption. Fort St. Francis was located where the St. Francis River met the Mississippi River in present day Arkansas. A few months later, they moved their forces to the Fourth Chickasaw Bluff, in present-day Memphis, Tennessee and named that site Fort Assumption. 

[^iii]: During this second campaign, Pierre Vitry kept a diary recording his daily experiences. Many of these entries note the presence of Africans and their descendents in the 1739 war campaign. For an English translation of this journal, see “Journal of Father Vitry of the Society of Jesus, Army Chaplain during the War Against the Chickasaw,” *Mid-America* 28, no. 1 (January 1946), 30-59.
